# Open-Core Strategy

## Principle

The open core must be fully functional without paid components.

## Open Components

- Context ingestion
- Deterministic context selection
- Context cache lifecycle
- MCP server
- CLI and SDKs

## Paid Components

- Context observability
- Drift detection
- Cost attribution
- Usage analytics
- Policy intelligence

## Boundary Rules

- Open components must never depend on paid components for correctness
- Paid components enhance visibility and operations, not core functionality
- All specs are publicly readable, even those describing paid features
