# Non-Goals

The following are explicitly out of scope for the Context Platform:

- **We are not a chatbot** — We provide context, not conversation
- **We are not a vector database replacement** — We complement, not replace, retrieval infrastructure
- **We do not train foundation models** — We optimize context delivery, not model weights
- **We do not optimize prompts dynamically at runtime** — Context selection is deterministic, not adaptive
