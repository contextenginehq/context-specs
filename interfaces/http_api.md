# HTTP API Specification

## Purpose

Provide HTTP endpoints for systems that cannot use MCP directly.

## Status

*To be specified.*

## Design Principles

- Mirror MCP semantics where possible
- RESTful resource model
- JSON request/response bodies
- Deterministic responses (same guarantees as MCP)
